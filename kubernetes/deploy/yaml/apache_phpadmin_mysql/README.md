Meant as a starter on setting up 
   * Mysql 8.0
   * PHPMyAdmin 
   * Apache2 with PHP 8.2 

and teaching both good and bad practices. This is meant as an easy starting point for Kubernetes/MiniKube. 

You start with
- cloning this repos (of course) 
- navigating to PHPMYADMIN_MYSQL and running **kubectl apply -k ./ ** 
- running **minikube service lamp** 
- navigating to APACHE_MYQL and running **kubectl apply -k ./ **
- running **minikube service lamp** 

Open both service URLs in browser to see PHPMyAdmin and Apache+PHP server in action. 
Details for user names/password have been shared separately.
